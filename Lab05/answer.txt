If exceptions are not properly handled in the play() method, any errors that occur during execution can lead to program instability or undesirable behavior. Without an appropriate exception-handling mechanism, errors will remain unmanaged and may result in serious consequences, such as causing the application to terminate unexpectedly, become unresponsive, or exhibit unpredictable behaviors. This not only reduces the overall stability of the software but also disrupts the user experience and makes it challenging to diagnose or resolve the underlying issues. Therefore, implementing effective exception handling in the play() method is crucial to ensure the application's reliability, stability, and safety.
