Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?  
-> JAVA is a Pass by Value programming language 

After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain? 
-> Titles unchanged after swap: Java passes references by value, so the method 
swaps only local copies, leaving the original references outside unchanged. 

After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
-> Title changed after changeTitle: The method modifies the object's state directly 
via setTitle, affecting the actual object referenced by jungleDVD.
